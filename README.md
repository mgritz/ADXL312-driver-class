# Linux driver for ADXL312 IMU

This is a driver abstraction for the ADXL312 inertial measurement unit.

It was originally used with the odroid single chip computer but should work also with
raspberry pi or any other machine that runs Linux and has a hardware I2C interface.

The actual i2c driver is adapted from a library I found on the net and should also be compile in C.
